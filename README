This is a Fork of https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors

normal mode:
Add <leader>h key support for match cursors without jump

visual mode:
Add <leader>h key support for visual mode. You can select some text (using visual mode) and then press n/N for searching (don't jump to the next/prev match).

Thinks to: 
https://github.com/bronson/vim-visual-star-search (for visual mode star key support)
